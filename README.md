# Welcome to the Humanoid Sensing and Perception Github organization

The Humanoid Sensing and Perception is within Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

Our group studies algorithms and technologies that allow robots to sense the environment and react appropriately. Our strategy is to exploit the capability of robots to learn under human guidance or from the interaction with the environment by exploiting multiple sources of information (e.g. proprioception, vision, touch, and audition). We work on visual and tactile perception, with applications in robot manipulation and navigation. We also develop software tools and study software integration methodologies for the development of complex behaviors.

Our platforms are the iCub humanoid robot and R1.
