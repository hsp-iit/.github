# Welcome to the Humanoid Sensing and Perception Github organization

The Humanoid Sensing and Perception is within Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

Our group studies algorithms and technologies that allow robots to sense the environment 
and react appropriately. Our strategy is to exploit the capability of robots to learn under 
human guidance or from the interaction with the environment by exploiting multiple sources 
of information (e.g. proprioception, vision, touch, and audition). We work on visual and 
tactile perception, for robot navigation and object manipulation. 
We also develop software tools and study software integration methodologies for
the development of complex behaviors.

Our platforms are the iCub and R1 humanoid robots, we focus on applications in the domain of
service robotics.

Whenever possible we make code related to our research available to the community with open-source licenses.
